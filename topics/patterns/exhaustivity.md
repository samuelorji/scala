A common thought when writing a pattern match is knowing whether we are handling all possible inputs.
Conversely, we could ask, is it possible to provide an input to the pattern match expression which would match
_none_ of the patterns? This is not usually something we would want to happen. It would mean that the expression
is _partial_, not _total_. If we were to pass a scrutinee to the pattern match which it could not handle, in the
absence of any possible return expression, the only action that makes sense is for an exception to be thrown.
So, Scala will throw a `MatchError`.

# Wildcard matches

To avoid partiality in the pattern match, one solution is to use a _wildcard_ pattern. This is not really a
"pattern" at all, because it is guaranteed to match the scrutinee every time, but that's exactly what we need to
ensure _totality_.

In it's simplest form, a wildcard match uses the pattern, `_`. It must be the last case in a pattern match; if
we know it will match everything, then there would not be any point attempting to match on something else
_after_ a wildcard, and, in fact, the compiler considers it an error.
```scala
def chooseTheme(background: Color): Theme =
  background match
    case Black => Theme.Light
    case White => Theme.Dark
    case _     => Theme.Adaptive
```

The `_` pattern is useful if we don't care to _use_ the value we have matched in the case clause, but if we do,
then we can use a new identifier in place of the `_`, for example,
```scala
def message(count: Int): String = count match
  case 1 => "There is one."
  case 2 => "There are two."
  case 3 => "There are three."
  case n => s"There are $n."
```

Here, we introduce a new identifier, `n`, which is bound to the scrutinee where it has failed to match `1`, `2` or `3`. This
is something we have seen already, in fact. When we wrote the pattern, earlier,
```scala
case Color(red, green, blue) =>
```
the identifiers, `red`, `green` and `blue` are also patterns which are used to "match" against the three
parameters of `Color`, but being wildcard patterns, we know they will always match. So their primary function is
to bind new identifiers to each of the three parameters so we can use them directly on the right-hand side
of the case clause.

# Enumerations and Sealed types

A wildcard match does not always make sense, though. If we were to to match a scrutinee which was an
`Option[Int]`, we would know that matching `case Some(value)` and `case None` would be guaranteed to match.
`Option[T]` is a sealed type, so there are no other possible subtypes other than these, and therefore no
need to provide a wildcard match at the end to handle any other cases.

This is something Scala is also able to work out, as long as the type of the scrutinee is a union type, a
sealed type such as an enumeration, a `Boolean` or, trivially, a `Unit`. This feature is called _exhaustivity
checking_, and we say that it checks that the match is _exhaustive_ in the sense that it _exhausts_ the set of
possible values such that there is nothing left to try to match against. And it guarantees the _totality_ of the
match expression, which is something we want.

Provided Scala can prove that, collectively, the cases listed inside a `match` will handle any value we pass to
it, it will consider the match exhaustive.

# Guards

Sometimes an extractor or the scrutinee's type don't give us enough ways to express exactly which cases we would
like to match, and which we wouldn't. Scala allows additional checks to be performed on the scrutinee, _after_
extraction and typechecking, but _before_ agreeing to match the case. These are called _guards_ and we can think
of them as "guarding" the execution on the right-hand side of the case clause; a final check "at the door". The
syntax for guards reuses the `if` keyword with a predicate between the pattern and the `=>` symbol, like so,
```scala
def howMany(value: Int): String = value match
  case 1           => "one"
  case 2           => "two"
  case n if n < 10 => "a few"
  case n           => n.toString
```

The match expression will check first if the scrutinee is equal to `1`, then if it is equal to `2`, then if it
is less than `10`, and if none of these cases match, the scrutinee is bound to the identifier `n`, and is
converted to a `String`.

Remember that the order of the cases is important. If we were to shuffle the order they appear in the list, it
could change the behavior of the match.

# Ability to check Exhaustivity (beginner)

For each case in a match, Scala will ask itself a question: do there exist any instances of the scrutinee which
earlier cases would not match, but which this case would match? And for the entire match, it asks, are there
any instances of the scrutinee which none of the cases would match, and if so, what are they?

Based on the answers to these questions, Scala may issue warnings about the code. If it decides that a case
will never match because one of the earlier cases would always match it first, then we will receive a warning
that it is an _unreachable case_; it's provably impossible that it will never match. Likewise, if it is possible
for a particular scrutinee instance to pass over every case in the expression without matching any of them, then
a warning is issued: "match may not be exhaustive". We even get insight into the cases which are not handled.

Remember that these questions are asked with the knowledge that Scala has available to it at compile time. It
knows nothing about the runtime value of the scrutinee, apart from its type. Scala is also limited in its
ability to analyse the predicates in guards: a predicate could be _any_ expression which returns a `Boolean`
value, even a nondeterministic expression, so the compiler makes no assumptions about whether a guarded case
will always match, never match or sometimes match, even when it might be obvious to us.
